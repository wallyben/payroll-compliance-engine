Payroll Compliance Engine

Architecture Rules:
- core/ contains deterministic compliance logic only.
- apps/api contains orchestration only.
- No compliance logic inside routers.
- No scoring logic in API.
- No side effects inside rule engine.

Editing Rules:
- Do not modify rule behavior without updating tests.
- Do not refactor entire repo.
- Modify minimal files.
- Remove .bak files before expanding features.
- Always preserve phase freeze constraints.

Before implementing changes:
1. Propose plan.
2. List affected files.
3. Implement minimal patch.
